## Step 5: Save

Save the event type to apply your changes. Make sure you toggle "Show on Booking Page" to off (To the left of the trash icon).

That's it! The Thred script will automatically pick up calendar bookings and track page views.

## Important

<Warning>
  Make sure you have the Thred tracking script installed on your website before configuring Cal.com. Without the script, the integration will not work.
